# coebot-www
A web interface for [CoeBot](https://bitbucket.org/tucker_gardner/coebot), a Twitch.tv chat moderation bot.

## Installation
This site is still very early in development so I'm not gonna bother writing detailed install instructions that might change dramatically later, but it's mostly just a standard AMP (Apache/MySQL/PHP) application. Put the files on an Apache server with PHP and enable .htaccess files or copy the contents of the .htaccess file to your Apache config file. The database structure can be rebuilt using the file dbstructure.sql (which I will do my best to keep up to date).

You might notice that one particular file is missing. To keep secret data safe, I put confidential details in a file called safeconfig.php that isn't posted to GitHub. Here's what that file looks like so that you can recreate it:

```php
<?php

// mysql details for new site
define(DB_SERV, "<ip/hostname of mysql server>");
define(DB_USER, "<mysql username>");
define(DB_PASS, "<mysql password>");
define(DB_NAME, "<mysql database name>");
define(DB_PREF, "<prefix to prepend to all table names>");

// mysql details for highlights site
define(DB_HIGHLIGHTS_SERV, "<ip/hostname of mysql server>");
define(DB_HIGHLIGHTS_USER, "<mysql username>");
define(DB_HIGHLIGHTS_PASS, "<mysql password>");
define(DB_HIGHLIGHTS_DATA, "<mysql database name>");

?>
```

The site is in pretty rapid development right now and this version of the file is going to become outdated (in fact, it already is); please contact me if you need help with this.

## Private API
This site uses a private API to communicate with CoeBot. This API is still in planning and is rapidly evolving (do not assume currently existing endpoints will exist indefinitely), but the specification so far is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tQNETtRvTuSdGKEep57yuO_8J_YfjS5J3--Q6vH0Rcc/edit?usp=sharing). The source code of api.php is considered more canonical than this document for the time being however.
