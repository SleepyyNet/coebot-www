# coebot-www
A web interface for [Coebot](https://bitbucket.org/tucker_gardner/coebot), a Twitch.tv chat moderation bot.

## Installation
This site is still very early in development so I'm not gonna bother writing detailed install instructions that might change dramatically later, but it's mostly just a standard AMP (Apache/MySQL/PHP) application. Put the files on an Apache server with PHP and enable .htaccess files or copy the contents of the .htaccess file to your Apache config file.

## Private API
This site uses a private API to communicate with Coebot. This API is still in planning, but the specification so far is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tQNETtRvTuSdGKEep57yuO_8J_YfjS5J3--Q6vH0Rcc/edit?usp=sharing)
