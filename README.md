# coebot-www
A web interface for [Coebot](https://bitbucket.org/tucker_gardner/coebot), a Twitch.tv chat moderation bot.

## Installation
This site is still very early in development so I'm not gonna bother writing detailed install instructions that might change dramatically later, but it's mostly just a standard AMP (Apache/MySQL/PHP) application. Put the files on an Apache server with PHP and enable .htaccess files or copy the contents of the .htaccess file to your Apache config file.

## Private API
This site uses a private API to communicate with Coebot. This API is still in planning, but the specification so far is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tQNETtRvTuSdGKEep57yuO_8J_YfjS5J3--Q6vH0Rcc/edit?usp=sharing).

## License
For the time being, this project is licensed under the [GNU General Public License v2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt). However, it is very possible that I may switch to a more permissive license (like LGPL or MIT) very soon. As a consequence of being between licenses, I probably won't be able to accept contributions from other people. Potential features and suggestions are very welcome, but unfortunately I can't accept pull requests very easily until I've made up my mind.

## Issue tracker
Since I'm the only person working on this project for the most part, I have opted to use [this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/7hVc2TY1) to track my issues, as I tend to lose patience for GitHub issues. However, I will also keep an eye on GitHub's issue tracker, so you can submit bugs/suggestions/etc via GitHub.
